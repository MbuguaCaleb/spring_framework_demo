**Sharing my Classes and Objects**

```aidl

Spring helps me share my classes across the project much more easily than when using raw Java


There are three methods though which classes are shared across:


1.Via XML

BEANS  ETC

THEN REFERENCING THEM IN MY CLASS

When we get the classes via XML without having to Inject them or
without raw Java, we are extracting them from the Spring Container.
